# The Odin Project

Will eventually branch the more significant projects onto seperate repos.


Currently doing ruby, will probably skip the computer science section because I've already coded every (data-structures) project on there except one in C++


Will do RoR next, and indepth HTML+CSS because my current skills need great improvement and actual formal teaching on the "right way" to do things.


Probably no time for advanced JavaScript (and nodeJS) before the school semester starts, though...
